Godot Template Copy
===================

Just a Windoze batch file that duplicates a [Godot][1] template directory and saves it under a new (project) name.  
The Godot project file inside the new directory will automatically be changed.

No more wasting the first ten minutes with adding environments, cameras, grounds ....

You only need the batch file; no need to clone everything.  
The rest of this "project" (lol) is only for demonstration.

Rename the source template name in the top of the batch file to your liking.
